The notebooks in this repository are meant to exemplify the use of that API in the context of the IDR, and the sort of queries that can be done. In particular, they show how to reproduce Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the paper.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> They also make use of the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem, including [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).\n",
