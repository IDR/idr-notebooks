    "To analyse the data, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the Project https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-51\n",
    "2. Note its ID displayed on the right-hand panel\n",
    "3. Launch Fiji\n",
    "4. Go to *File > New > Script...*\n",
    "5. A dialog pops up. In the *Language* menu select *Python*\n",
    "6. Copy the content of the script [idr0021.jy](includes/idr0021.jy) into the text editor\n",
    "7. Edit USERNAME and PASSWORD\n",
    "8. Click *Run*\n",
    "9. The script will process all Images in the specified Project. The following steps will be applied to each image:\n",
    "    - Convert floating-point pixel-type to 8-bit using *8-bit* \n",
    "    - Apply *Auto Threshold* with the *method* set to *MaxEntropy* and *stack* option selected\n",
    "    - Apply *Analyze Particles* with the *Size* set to *10-Infinity* and the *Pixel units* checked.\n",
    "    - Parse the results to only keep a summary of the statistics of the channel which name is matching the name of the dataset are kept. To identify the channel, we read the map annotation associated to the image.The map annotation contains pairs (emission wavelength, protein).\n",
    "    - Save the summary as a CSV file. One file per Image\n",
    "10. All the CSV files are then aggregated into a single CSV file."
